# Aurora-Autos
Welcome to Aurora Autos!

This repository contains the code for a responsive and modern website for a fictional car dealership. I built this website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. The website features a navbar, carousel, and cards displaying information about the company and its inventory of cars.

As a frontend developer, I pride myself on my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I hope you enjoy exploring the code for this project, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank you for visiting!
